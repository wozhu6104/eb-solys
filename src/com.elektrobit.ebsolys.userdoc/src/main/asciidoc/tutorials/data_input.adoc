=== Providing {solys} with data

==== Scope and content

To provide {solys} with data to be analyzed, it needs to either load a file or
directly be connected to a target system that is equipped with the {targetagent}.

===== Opening a log file

A log file can be opened from the start dialog or from the file menu.
You need to be careful when opening files when data has already been loaded into
{solys}.

[TIP]
For educational purposes, a demo trace is included that can directly be loaded
from the start dialog. It loads sample data of an automotive navigation system.
Also a demo script is executed that processes some data and generates sample charts.

===== Connecting to a target device

A connection to a target device requires the {targetagent} to be present, <<./index.adoc#anchor-configure-ta, configured>>
and launched. It will open an IP socket connection that can be connected to from the host.

Either directly configure the connection from the start menu shown above or by adding a connection
in the {resource-explorer}.

Once a connection is established, {view}s will be updated with live data and
callback scripts will react to new events.

To do further analysis, the live mode can be paused and switched to analysis mode by clicking

and resumed.
