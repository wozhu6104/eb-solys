==== Line Chart Settings

image::..\resources\line-chart-preferences.png[]

For {chart}s, three types of attributes can be configured. The type, the representation
and the way, the Y-axis handles with values exceeding its current range.
The _chart type_ will determine if the chart is rendered as a bar or a line chart.
By changing the _chart representation_, the chart can be configured to show a single
line per channel, a filled area below the line or all lines stacked above each
other to visually represent the sum of values for multiple channels.
The behavior of the _y-axis scale_ can be configured to be fixed with a minimum
and a maximum value. It can be semi-dynamic, starting with a certain maximum and
increasing if the value is exceeded or completely dynamic and adapt to the maximum
value within the visible time frame.

==== Color Settings

image::..\resources\color-preferences.png[]

For each channel a certain color is assigned as soon as th e channel is used at
least in one resource. If the channel is used in different views it can then be
visually identified with this assigned color. As default {solys} comes with a
preset of 12 colors. Since there usually more channels than colors, different
channels may share the same color. You can change the color palette by either
changing the value or adding new colors or even remove existing colors. The channel
color is also used in tables as background color of events. For a better readability
a transparency value is set to 80% as default. This can be changed to a value
between 0% and 100%.

==== Time Format Settings

image::..\resources\time-format-preferences.png[]

Each <<./index.adoc#anchor-events, runtime event>> has a timestamp
measured in microseconds, whereas the value can be an absolute time or a relative
time since system start-up (also known as system ticks). If it is an absolute or
rleative time depends on how it was measured on the target device. Nevertheless
you can set how the timestamp should be represented in tables and charts. You have
a set of predefined formats or you can define your own format as long as it is a
valid java timeformat string.
